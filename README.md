# HTML_CSS_Study


### This repo tracks my HTML & CSS learning. So far, it includes tutorial work from
- [HTML & CSS Crash Course](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/html-and-css-crash-course) by [netninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G)

# "*HTML & CSS Crash Course*"

### What you'll find here:
- A [demo](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/HTML_CSS_Study/blob/main/HTML/demo.html) synthesizing what I learned
- My study [notes](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/HTML_CSS_Study/blob/main/NOTES.md) taken during the series
- Practice files for both vanilla HTML and CSS-infused HTML

### How to interact with this repo:
- If you'd like to see the demo and/or my practice files, clone this repo locally and load the `demo.html` page in your browser (you will need an application like "Live server" or "Nodemon" in order to load both the CSS and HTML properly). The project runs on [localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500), so navigate either to [localhost:5500/HTML/demo.html](http://localhost:5500/HTML/demo.html) or [localhost:5500/HTML/index.html](http://localhost:5500/HTML/index.html) to see the synthesized project or the landing page, respectively. 

### Why'd I do this tutorial?
- I needed a quick refresher and cementer, before I dove into modern CSS and JavaScript frameworks. In the past, I've learned these two languages piecemeal, and wanted to do at least one "101" course to make sure my fundamentals were solid.
