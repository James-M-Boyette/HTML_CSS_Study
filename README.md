# HTML_CSS_NetNinja

### This repo follows an introductory [tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/html-and-css-crash-course) series by [netninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G) for HTML & CSS.

### What you'll find here:

- My [notes](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/Docker-Net-Ninja-/blob/main/NOTES.md) from the series
- Dockerfile(s), .dockerignore(s), and a docker-compose.yaml file
- Simple front and back end applications to be used in conjunction with Docker (essentially for demo and testing purposes only)

### How to interact with this repo:

- If you'd like to run both front and back end containers, clone this repo locally and run `docker-compose up` at the root of the project. Then, open two internet browser tabs and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) (the React front end, and Node API back end, respectively). If all goes well, you should see a simple listing of blog posts in the first and a json object in the second.
- If you'd like to test out the Dockerfiles, use the commands I've listed in the "Working with Docker console" section of my [notes](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/Docker-Net-Ninja-/blob/main/NOTES.md#7-starting--stopping-containers) to create/update/delete images, containers and volumes

### Why'd I do the tutorial?

- This is a quick refresher and cementer, before I do a bunch of modern CSS, front end framework, and architecture practice/development

- Background:

  > Most of my experience with HTML & CSS is itterative: often, I had a small problem and quickly "googled a thing". I really enjoy being well-versed in these languages, because even though they're relatively simple ones, they're also (obviously) ubiquitous. At this point, I trust the tutorial's content creator to structure things in such a way that

  > 1. Any _essentials_ I missed will get covered and,

  > 2. I can finally feel roundly confident this skill's in the ol' toolbox ğŸ§°ğŸ¤“ğŸ’ª
