        <h2>My Fav Superheros ...</h2>
        <p class="summary-thoughts">
          Why comic book characters? Lately, I've been doing a lot of 3D art work focused on DC's pantheon. So, of course, they're top-of-mind ðŸ˜‡ðŸ¤“ That said, my first love will always be Marvel, with characters like Hulk & Rogue as stand-out examples of an artistic choice I've been considering ... 
        </p>
        <p class="summary-thoughts"> That choice is "How should this character look?"
          <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">"How thick should they be?"</span>
              </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">"How defined (or not)?"</span>
              </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">"What parts should be more exagerated, and what should be as we'd expect?"</span>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="summary-thoughts"> I've become fascinated by the challenge of communicating backstory through these physical choices. It's more than just making sure characters square with their professions etc (a self-professed professional gymnast should look more or less like other gymnasts) - physique can tell you about what people are capable of, what they care about, and even hidden character traits. 
        </p>
        <p class="summary-thoughts"> An example I've been working on lately is Superman: how do you communicate that he's different than normal humans? Make him big. But he can't be too big, or we lose connection to him as a sympathetic, human-esque character. And what about his origin story? He's a synergy: a character that <em>should</em> be human, except that he's an alien - so what parts of his body should be bigger? What parts smaller? It seems that for a long time, he was drawn either to look like Christopher Reeve (who had a massive chest/ribcage) or to just <em>feel</em> bigger - while his arms are relatively smaller (and his legs are smaller-still). 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Superman (DC)</li>
          <li>Hulk (Marvel)</li>
          <li>Rogue (Marvel)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are links to some of my favorite examples:</p>

        <h2>My Fav Star Wars Moments ...</h2>
        <p class="summary-thoughts">
          What about Star Wars? Well, there are moments that I absolutely love: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When Han shot first (why, why, why was this changed? I'm obviously beating a dead horse, but it was a defining character moment that added complexity to a kids story ðŸ˜–)</li>
          <li>Anything with Lando (in the original trilogy). He added another <em>swagger</em> element to the otherwise ernest, "good v evil" tone of the story. And if you've read any books from the 90's, Zahn's version is even cooler ðŸ˜Ž</li>
          <li>The space battles. I cannot express how happy I am that George (with influence from Steven) attempted to capture the spirit of airplane dog fights in these combat scenes. The influence pays off with action one can follow and empathise with, as well as be surprised by (when they do special, "spaceship-y" things you didn't expect from their conventional forefathers).</li>
        </ul>
